Description: This package allows you to fairly easily copy a path from Windows 
    Explorer or other Windows applications that use backslashes (\) as the
    deliminator and  paste into R which uses either forward slashes (/) 
    or an escaped backslash (\\). To use it one would copy a path, call 
    either fslash() or bslash() to convert the path in the clipboard and then
    paste. Additionally, there is a function winopen() for opening files
    and folders with Windows Explorer or the application associated with 
    the target file in Windows.
